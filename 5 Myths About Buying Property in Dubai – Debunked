5 Myths About Buying Property in Dubai – Debunked

Dubai is often seen as a land of opportunity, sunshine, skyscrapers, luxury cars, and ambitious growth. But when it comes to buying property, a lot of misconceptions still float around.
Whether you’re a curious expat, a first-time investor, or just researching your options, here are 5 common myths about the Dubai real estate market, and the truth you need to know before making a decision.

Myth 1: “You need to be a UAE resident to buy property in Dubai”

Wrong.

Dubai is one of the most open real estate markets in the world. Foreigners can legally buy property in designated freehold areas, and you don’t need to be a resident to do so.
In fact, many investors [**buy from abroad without ever visiting**](https://www.oro24.com), thanks to digital transactions and trusted agents.

Reality: You can own property 100% as a foreigner, even if you’re not a UAE resident.

Myth 2: “Buying in Dubai is only for the rich”

Absolutely not.

While luxury properties in Palm Jumeirah or Emirates Hills might grab headlines, there are plenty of affordable options too. Studios in areas like JVC, Dubai South, or Town Square can start as low as 450,000 AED (~$120,000), and many off-plan developers offer [**payment plans with 1% per month.**](https://www.oro24.com)


Reality: You can enter the market with a reasonable budget, especially with off-plan deals.

⁃ Myth 3: “Off-plan is always risky”

Off-plan properties (buying before construction is finished) used to carry more risk. But today, strict RERA regulations require developers to use escrow accounts, register all projects, and meet legal milestones.
Of course, not all off-plan projects are equal, so you still need to research the developer and payment terms. But many investors now choose off-plan to maximize returns.

Reality: Off-plan is safe if you choose the right developer and understand the contract.

⁃ Myth 4: “You can’t get a mortgage as an expat”

False again.

Banks in the UAE do offer [**mortgages to non-residents and expats**](https://www.oro24.com), with certain conditions. Most require:
• A minimum down payment (usually 20–25%)
• Proof of income and employment
• Clean credit history
If you’re buying off-plan, many developers also offer in-house financing or post-handover plans — often with no interest.

Reality: Mortgages are accessible to many expats, and developer payment plans can be even more flexible.

⁃ Myth 5: “It’s better to rent because the market is too unstable”

Dubai’s market has had ups and downs, like any global city. But recent years have shown strong recovery, smart regulations, and consistent demand, especially in the mid-market and short-term rental segments.
If you plan to stay in Dubai for more than 3–5 years, buying often makes more financial sense than renting, especially with rising rents.

Reality: With proper planning, owning can offer better value and long-term stability than renting.

Final Thoughts

Dubai is one of the most dynamic and investor-friendly markets in the world, but like any major decision, you need facts, not fear.
Don’t let outdated ideas stop you from exploring your options. With the right information, a reliable agent, and a clear budget, buying property in Dubai can be safe, accessible, and even fun.
